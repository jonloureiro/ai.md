# Knowledge Base — Index

> Research findings, validated techniques, and domain knowledge used by all agents in this workspace.
> Before researching a topic, check this index first. If recent research exists, use it instead of re-researching.

## Research Files

| File | Topic | Last Updated | Freshness |
|---|---|---|---|
| [context-engineering.md](research/context-engineering.md) | Context Engineering paradigm, attention budget, token economics | 2026-02-14 | Current |
| [claude-4-best-practices.md](research/claude-4-best-practices.md) | Claude 4.x prompting best practices, breaking changes from Claude 3.x | 2026-02-14 | Current |
| [multi-agent-patterns.md](research/multi-agent-patterns.md) | Multi-agent architectures, orchestration patterns, context isolation | 2026-02-14 | Current |
| [attention-and-context-limits.md](research/attention-and-context-limits.md) | Context window performance degradation, lost-in-the-middle, practical limits | 2026-02-14 | Current |

## Freshness Rules

- **Current**: Researched within the last 3 months. Use directly.
- **Aging**: Researched 3-6 months ago. Use but verify key claims against current docs.
- **Stale**: Researched 6+ months ago. Re-research before relying on findings.

## How to Use

1. **Before researching**: Check this index. If a relevant file exists and is Current or Aging, read it first.
2. **After researching**: Create a new file or update an existing one. Update this index.
3. **File format**: See any existing file for the standard structure (Topic, Sources, Key Findings, Implications).
