# Knowledge Base — Index

> Research findings, validated techniques, and domain knowledge used by all agents in this workspace.
> Before researching a topic, check this index first. If recent research exists, use it instead of re-researching.

## Freshness Rules

- **Current**: Researched within the last 3 months. Use directly.
- **Aging**: Researched 3-6 months ago. Use but verify key claims against current docs.
- **Stale**: Researched 6+ months ago. Re-research before relying on findings.

## How to Use

1. **Before researching**: Check this index. If a relevant file exists and is Current or Aging, read it first.
2. **After researching**: Create a new file or update an existing one. Update this index.
3. **File format**: See any existing file for the standard structure (Topic, Sources, Key Findings, Implications).
