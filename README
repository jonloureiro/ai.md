What is this?

  A prompt engineering workspace. It designs, tests, and optimizes system
  prompts for LLM agents. The output is not application code — it is the
  instructions that define how other AI agents think and behave.

  It works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Zed,
  and Jules.


How to use it

  This workspace has three agents that form a pipeline. You invoke them
  through your AI coding assistant (Claude Code, OpenCode, etc.).

  1. Planner (prompt-architect-planner)

     Start here. Tell the Planner what agent you want to build. It will ask
     questions to understand your requirements and produce an architecture
     spec — a blueprint for the prompt.

     In Claude Code:  /prompt-architect-planner
     In OpenCode:     @prompt-architect-planner

  2. Builder (prompt-architect-builder)

     Give the Builder the architecture spec from the Planner. It writes the
     actual system prompt following the spec.

     In Claude Code:  /prompt-architect-builder
     In OpenCode:     @prompt-architect-builder

  3. Reviewer (prompt-architect-reviewer)

     Give the Reviewer the system prompt from the Builder plus the original
     architecture spec. It creates test scenarios, evaluates the prompt, and
     decides whether to approve or reject it.

     In Claude Code:  /prompt-architect-reviewer
     In OpenCode:     @prompt-architect-reviewer

  The typical flow is:

     Planner -> Builder -> Reviewer -> (approve or iterate)

  Most agents take 1-2 iterations before approval. If the Reviewer rejects,
  go back to the Builder for writing issues or to the Planner for
  architectural issues.


Quick edits

  For small changes to an existing prompt, skip the Planner and go directly
  to the Builder with your change request, then to the Reviewer for a
  quick review.
